## Description

- The file integration_displacement contains a function that must receive as parameters, the initial velocity x, y and z, the final velocity 
in terms of x, y and z, and must receive the initial time and final time. All of this parameters must be inside a list container and the orders is important. Which means . To find displacement we have to find the product between the rate of change in velocity and the rate of change in time:
                  
                                        displacement = Δvelocity * Δtime
                                                  
- The function will return a list that contains the displacement in terms of x, y and z. This means that the function can be called to store the displacement in a variable or to print it directly. This will let us use the functions to get the values and do manipulate it however we want.
                                                  
## Usage

- d = displacement([0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0]

or

- print(displacement([0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0])

others ways can be used.
